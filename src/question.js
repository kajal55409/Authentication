// ### Project Overview:
 
// #### Objective:
// Develop a comprehensive mobile application to manage user attendance, allowing registered users to mark their attendance using geolocation while providing admin access to oversee user lists and details.
 
// ### Features:
 
// #### User Registration & Authentication:
// 1. **Registration Form:**
//    - Create a user registration form with fields for name, email, phone number, DOB, gender, habits, "About Me" description, and profile photo upload with validation.
// 2. **Separate Logins:**
//    - Implement separate login screens for admin and regular users with unique credentials.
 
// #### Admin Dashboard & User Management:
// 3. **Admin Access:**
//    - Upon successful admin login, direct to an admin-specific dashboard.
//    - Admins can manage user lists and details (CRUD operations: View, Edit, Delete).
 
// #### User Home Screen & Attendance Marking:
// 4. **Normal User:**
//    - After logging in, regular users should be directed to a home screen displaying their profile details (name, email, profile photo).
//    - Users can mark attendance using geolocation on their home screen.

// #### User Profile Details:
// 5. **Details View:**
//    - Allow users to view and edit their profile details, including name, email, phone number, DOB, habits, "About Me" description, and profile photo.
 
// ### Additional Considerations:

// - **Access Control:** Implement role-based access control to restrict normal users from accessing admin-exclusive functionalities.
// - **Form Validation:** Ensure proper validation for all input fields in the registration form and profile details.
// - **Geolocation Usage:** Utilize React Native's Geolocation API for attendance marking and fetching user locations.
// - **User Interface & Responsiveness:** Create a user-friendly interface that works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.
 
// ### Evaluation and Submission:
 
// - Evaluate the complete functionality of user registration, logins, admin dashboard features, attendance marking, and user profile management.
// - Candidates should submit the entire source code with setup instructions and any relevant notes on a version control platform like GitHub or Bitbucket.
// Registration form is done with validation
// login page is done with validation (left with logics to bring separate home)
// Admin Access: not done
// **Normal User:** - user can see the name and email
// #### User Profile Details: Not completed (left with fetching the data from async storage)
